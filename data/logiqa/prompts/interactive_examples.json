Until about ten years ago, sunscreens protected against UV-B radiation but not against UV-A radiation. Which one of the following is best supported by the information above? (A) People who wear sunscreen now are less likely to become sunburned than were people who spent the same amount of time in the sun wearing sunscreen ten years ago. (B) The specific cause of premature skin wrinkling was not known until about ten years ago. (C) Most people whose skin is prematurely wrinkled have spent a large amount of time in the sun without wearing sunscreen. (D) Until about ten years ago, people who wore sunscreen were no less likely to have premature wrinkles than were people who spent the same amount of time in the sun without wearing sunscreen.\nQuestion 1.1: Based on the passage and find the most relevant evidence to answer the question: what are the two types of UV radiation and their effects?\nAnswer 1.1: The passage mentions that UV-A radiation causes premature wrinkles and UV-B radiation causes sunburn. This evidence shows the distinct effects of each type of radiation.\nQuestion 1.2: Based on the passage and find the most relevant evidence to answer the question: what protection did sunscreens provide until about ten years ago?\nAnswer 1.2: The passage states that until about ten years ago, sunscreens protected against UV-B radiation but not against UV-A radiation. This evidence indicates the limitation of sunscreens at that time.\nQuestion 1.3: Based on the passage and find the most relevant evidence to answer the question: what is the consequence of sunscreens not protecting against UV-A radiation?\nAnswer 1.3: The passage implies that people were still exposed to UV-A radiation and at risk of premature wrinkles despite using sunscreen. This evidence highlights the ongoing risk due to lack of UV-A protection.\nQuestion 1.4: Based on the passage and find the most relevant evidence to answer the question: does it suggest that people who wear sunscreen now are less likely to become sunburned than those who wore sunscreen ten years ago?\nAnswer 1.4: The passage mentions that modern sunscreens likely protect against both UV-A and UV-B radiation, suggesting a reduced risk of sunburn. However, it does not explicitly compare sunburn risk between now and ten years ago. This evidence does not clearly support Option A.\nQuestion 1.5: Based on the passage and find the most relevant evidence to answer the question: does it indicate when the specific cause of premature skin wrinkling was discovered?\nAnswer 1.5: The passage states that UV-A radiation causes premature wrinkles and that sunscreens did not protect against UV-A until ten years ago. It does not specify when the cause of premature wrinkles was discovered. This evidence does not clearly support Option B.\nQuestion 1.6: Based on the passage and find the most relevant evidence to answer the question: does it provide information about the habits of people with prematurely wrinkled skin?\nAnswer 1.6: The passage mentions that UV-A radiation causes premature wrinkles but does not detail whether people with prematurely wrinkled skin used sunscreen or spent a lot of time in the sun without it. This evidence does not clearly support Option C.\nQuestion 1.7: Based on the passage and find the most relevant evidence to answer the question: were people who wore sunscreen ten years ago as likely to have premature wrinkles as those who did not wear sunscreen?\nAnswer 1.7: The passage states that sunscreens protected against UV-B but not UV-A radiation until ten years ago, meaning that people who wore sunscreen were still exposed to UV-A and thus likely to develop premature wrinkles, similar to those who did not wear sunscreen. This evidence supports Option D.\nQuestion 1.8: Now we can answer the question: Which one of the following is best supported by the information above?\nAnswer 1.8: Until about ten years ago, people who wore sunscreen were no less likely to have premature wrinkles than were people who spent the same amount of time in the sun without wearing sunscreen, since sunscreen did not protect against UV-A radiation that causes wrinkles. The answer is D.\n\nQuestion 2: A big company is going to hire a car driver at a high salary. After layers of screening, three competitors with the best technology are left. The examiner asked them, \"There is a piece of gold on the edge of the cliff. How close do you think you can get to the cliff without falling off?\" The first said, two meters. The second said, half a meter. The third said, \"I'll stay as far away from the cliff as POSSIBLE.\" The company hired the third. Which of the following is the main lesson of this event? (A) Don't fight temptation, but stay as far away from it as possible. (B) The most valuable people are not necessarily the most confident. (C) A person only for the immediate interests will eventually be short-lived things. (D) One aims high, but one also has to face the reality of life.\nQuestion 2.1: Based on the passage and find the most relevant evidence to answer the question: What is the scenario presented in the passage?\nAnswer 2.1: The passage states that a company is hiring a car driver and three candidates with the best skills are asked how close they can get to the edge of a cliff without falling off. This evidence provides context for the hiring process and the nature of the question.\nQuestion 2.2: Based on the passage and find the most relevant evidence to answer the question: What is the significance of the examiner's question about the cliff?\nAnswer 2.2: The passage implies that the examiner's question is designed to assess the candidates' judgment and approach to risk. This evidence indicates that the question is a metaphor for handling temptation and risk.\nQuestion 2.3: Based on the passage and find the most relevant evidence to answer the question: What are the specific responses of the three competitors to the examiner's question?\nAnswer 2.3: The passage states that the first competitor said two meters, the second said half a meter, and the third said he would stay as far away as possible. This evidence highlights the different approaches to risk and temptation among the candidates.\nQuestion 2.4: Based on the passage and find the most relevant evidence to answer the question: Why did the company choose to hire the third competitor?\nAnswer 2.4: The passage indicates that the company hired the third competitor because he demonstrated the most cautious and safest approach by choosing to stay as far away from the cliff as possible. This evidence shows that the company values risk aversion and caution.\nQuestion 2.5: Based on the passage and find the most relevant evidence to answer the question: Does the passage suggest avoiding temptation entirely rather than getting close to it?\nAnswer 2.5: The passage implies that the third competitor's decision to stay as far away from the cliff as possible suggests a strategy of completely avoiding temptation. This evidence supports Option A.\nQuestion 2.6: Based on the passage and find the most relevant evidence to answer the question: Does the passage discuss the value of confidence in people?\nAnswer 2.6: The passage indicates that the company did not hire the competitors who showed more confidence in getting closer to the cliff. Instead, it hired the one who was the most cautious. This evidence does not clearly support Option B.\nQuestion 2.7: Based on the passage and find the most relevant evidence to answer the question: Does the passage imply that focusing only on immediate interests is detrimental?\nAnswer 2.7: The passage states that the second competitor's attempt to get very close to the edge (half a meter) was not rewarded. This approach suggests focusing on immediate gain without considering the risk, implying that short-term thinking is not valued. This evidence weakly supports Option C.\nQuestion 2.8: Based on the passage and find the most relevant evidence to answer the question: Does the passage suggest balancing high aims with practical reality?\nAnswer 2.8: The passage does not discuss aiming high or balancing ambitions with reality. It focuses on risk avoidance and making safe choices. This evidence does not support Option D.\nQuestion 2.9: Now we can answer the question: Which of the following is the main lesson of this event? Based on the passage, find the most relevant evidence from the passage and answer the question.\nAnswer 2.9: The main lesson is to avoid temptation entirely rather than trying to get close to it without falling. The passage supports this by indicating that the company hired the third competitor because he chose to stay as far away from the cliff as possible. The answer is A.\n\n",
