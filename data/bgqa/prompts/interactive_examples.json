    "input": "Given a question, please decompose it into sub-questions. For each sub-question, please answer it in a complete sentence, ending with \"The answer is <your answer to the sub-question>\". When the original question is answerable, please start the final sub-question with \"Now we can answer the question: <original question>\", with a final answer ending with \"The answer is <proved/disproved/unknown>\".\n\nQuestion 1: A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The oscar offers a job to the octopus. The octopus does not eat the food of the elephant. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the oscar offers a job position to the octopus, then the octopus is not going to proceed to the spot that is right after the spot of the hare. Rule2: If you see that something knocks down the fortress of the cockroach but does not eat the food that belongs to the elephant, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it proceeds to the spot right after the hare. Rule2 is preferred over Rule1. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the octopus proceed to the spot right after the hare?\nQuestion 1.1: What is the current state of the game regarding the oscar and the octopus?\nAnswer 1.1: The current state of the game is that the oscar offers a job to the octopus. The answer is that the oscar offers a job to the octopus.\nQuestion 1.2: According to Rule 1, what happens if the oscar offers a job to the octopus?\nAnswer 1.2: According to Rule 1, if the oscar offers a job to the octopus, then the octopus does not proceed to the spot right after the hare. The answer is the octopus does not proceed to the spot right after the hare.\nQuestion 1.3: Does Rule 2 apply in the given situation, and if so, how does it affect the outcome?\nAnswer 1.3: Rule 2 would apply if the octopus knocked down the fortress of the cockroach and did not eat the food of the elephant, but there is no information proving this antecedent. Therefore, Rule 2 does not affect the outcome. The answer is Rule 2 does not apply.\nQuestion 1.4: Now we can answer the question: Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the octopus proceed to the spot right after the hare?\nAnswer 1.4: Since Rule 2 does not apply and according to Rule 1, the octopus does not proceed to the spot right after the hare, the statement \"the octopus proceeds to the spot right after the hare\" is false. The answer is disproved.\n\nQuestion 2: A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The hummingbird removes from the board one of the pieces of the pig. The pig struggles to find food. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Regarding the pig, if it has a sharp object, then we can conclude that it does not show all her cards to the crocodile. Rule2: Regarding the pig, if it has access to an abundance of food, then we can conclude that it does not show all her cards to the crocodile. Rule3: The pig unquestionably shows her cards (all of them) to the crocodile, in the case where the hummingbird learns the basics of resource management from the pig. Rule1 is preferred over Rule3. Rule2 is preferred over Rule3. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the pig show all her cards to the crocodile?\nQuestion 2.1: What is the current state of the game regarding the hummingbird and the pig?\nAnswer 2.1: The current state of the game is that the hummingbird removes one of the pieces of the pig, and the pig struggles to find food. The answer is that the hummingbird removes one of the pieces of the pig, and the pig struggles to find food.\nQuestion 2.2: According to the rules, what conditions prevent the pig from showing all her cards to the crocodile?\nAnswer 2.2: According to Rule 1, if the pig has a sharp object, it does not show all her cards to the crocodile. According to Rule 2, if the pig has access to an abundance of food, it does not show all her cards to the crocodile. The answer is having a sharp object or access to an abundance of food.\nQuestion 2.3: According to Rule 3, under what condition does the pig unquestionably show all her cards to the crocodile?\nAnswer 2.3: According to Rule 3, the pig unquestionably shows all her cards to the crocodile if the hummingbird learns the basics of resource management from the pig. The answer is if the hummingbird learns resource management from the pig.\nQuestion 2.4: Now we can answer the question: Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the pig show all her cards to the crocodile?\nAnswer 2.4: Since the current state indicates the pig struggles to find food (which implies it does not have an abundance of food) and there is no information about the pig having a sharp object or the hummingbird learning resource management, none of the rules can be definitively applied. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine if the pig shows all her cards to the crocodile. The answer is unknown.\n\nQuestion 3: A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The cheetah owes money to the swordfish. And the rules of the game are as follows.

Rule2: Regarding the kiwi, if it has fewer than 8 friends, then we can conclude that it does not need support from the doctorfish. Rule2 is preferred over Rule1.

The answer is the cheetah owes money to the swordfish.\nQuestion 3.2: According to the rules, when does the kiwi need or not need support from the doctorfish?\nAnswer 3.2: According to Rule 1, the kiwi needs the support of the doctorfish whenever at least one animal owes money to the swordfish.

The answer is No.\nQuestion 3.5: Now we can answer the question: Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the kiwi need support from the doctorfish?\nAnswer 3.5: Since the cheetah owes money to the swordfish and Rule 1 states that in such a case the kiwi needs support from the doctorfish, and there is no information proving that the kiwi has fewer than 8 friends to invoke Rule 2, we conclude that the kiwi needs support from the doctorfish. The answer is proved.\n\n",
