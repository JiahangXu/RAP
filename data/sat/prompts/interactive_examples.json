Thus, $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}} = \\frac{1}{27}$. The answer is $\\frac{1}{27}$.\nQuestion 1.2: What is $\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}}$?\nAnswer 1.2: Since $27 = 3^3$, we have $\\frac{1}{27} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\right)^3$. Thus, $\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}} = \\frac{1}{3}$. The answer is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\nQuestion 1.3: What is $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}}$?\nAnswer 1.3: $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$. The answer is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nQuestion 1.4: Simplify $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$ with a rational denominator.\nAnswer 1.4: Rationalizing the denominator, we get $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$. The answer is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.\nQuestion 1.5: Now we can answer the question: Simplify and write the result with a rational denominator: $\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}$.\nAnswer 1.5: The result of the simplification is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$. The answer is D.\n\nQuestion 2: Five thousand dollars compounded annually at an $x\\%$ interest rate takes six years to double. At the same interest rate, how many years will it take $\\$300$ to grow to $\\$9600$? A.12  B.1  C.30  D.5\nQuestion 2.1: What is the sum of the students' test scores?\nAnswer 2.1: The sum of the scores is $45 + 55 + 50 + 70 + 65 + 80 + 40 + 90 + 70 + 85 = 650$. The answer is 650.\nQuestion 2.2: How many students took the biology test?\nAnswer 2.2: Ten students took the test. The answer is 10.\nQuestion 2.3: What is the mean of the students' test scores?\nAnswer 2.3: The mean is calculated by dividing the sum of the scores by the number of students. So, $\\frac{650}{10} = 65$. The answer is 65.\nQuestion 2.4: Now we can answer the question: Ten students take a biology test and receive the following scores: 45, 55, 50, 70, 65, 80, 40, 90, 70, 85. What is the mean of the students’ test scores?\nAnswer 2.4: The mean of the students’ test scores is 65. The answer is D.\n\nQuestion 3: Joe was in charge of lights for a dance. The red light blinks every two seconds, the yellow light every three seconds, and the blue light every five seconds. If we include the very beginning and very end of the dance, how many times during a seven minute dance will all the lights come on at the same time? (Assume that all three lights blink simultaneously at the very beginning of the dance.) A.3  B.15  C.6  D.5\nQuestion 3.1: How many seconds are there in seven minutes?\nAnswer 3.1: There are $7 \times 60 = 420$ seconds in seven minutes. The answer is 420.\nQuestion 3.2: What is the least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, and 5?\nAnswer 3.2: The prime factors of 2, 3, and 5 are 2, 3, and 5, respectively. Therefore, the LCM is $2 \times 3 \times 5 = 30$. The answer is 30.\nQuestion 3.3: How many times will the lights all come on at the same time during the dance, including the beginning and the end?\nAnswer 3.3: We need to find how many multiples of 30 are there in 420 seconds. The multiples of 30 in 420 are $30, 60, 90, \\ldots, 420$. The number of multiples is $\\frac{420}{30} + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15$. The answer is 15.\nQuestion 3.4: Now we can answer the question: Joe was in charge of lights for a dance. The red light blinks every two seconds, the yellow light every three seconds, and the blue light every five seconds. If we include the very beginning and very end of the dance, how many times during a seven minute dance will all the lights come on at the same time?\nAnswer 3.4: The lights will all come on at the same time 15 times during the seven minute dance. The answer is B.\n\nQuestion 4: The variable $x$ varies directly as the square of $y$, and $y$ varies directly as the cube of $z$. If $x$ equals $-16$ when $z$ equals 2, what is the value of $x$ when $z$ equals $\\frac{1}{2}$? A.-1  B.16  C.$-\\frac{1}{256}$  D.$\\frac{1}{16}$\nQuestion 4.1: If $x$ varies directly as the square of $y$, what is the relationship between $x$ and $y$?\nAnswer 4.1: The relationship is $x = k_1 y^2$ for some constant $k_1$. The answer is $x = k_1 y^2$.\nQuestion 4.2: If $y$ varies directly as the cube of $z$, what is the relationship between $y$ and $z$?\nAnswer 4.2: The relationship is $y = k_2 z^3$ for some constant $k_2$. The answer is $y = k_2 z^3$.\nQuestion 4.3: Substitute $y = k_2 z^3$ into $x = k_1 y^2$ to find the relationship between $x$ and $z$.\nAnswer 4.3: Substituting $y$ into the equation for $x$, we get $x = k_1 (k_2 z^3)^2 = k_1 k_2^2 z^6$. The answer is $x = k_1 k_2^2 z^6$.\nQuestion 4.4: Given $x = -16$ when $z = 2$, find the value of the constant $k = k_1 k_2^2$.\nAnswer 4.4: We have $-16 = k (2^6) = k \\cdot 64$. Therefore, $k = \\frac{-16}{64} = -\\frac{1}{4}$. The answer is $-\\frac{1}{4}$.\nQuestion 4.5: Now we can answer the question: What is the value of $x$ when $z = \\frac{1}{2}$, given that $x = k z^6$ with $k = -\\frac{1}{4}$?\nAnswer 4.5: We have $x = -\\frac{1}{4} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = -\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{64} = -\\frac{1}{256}$. The answer is C.\n\n",
