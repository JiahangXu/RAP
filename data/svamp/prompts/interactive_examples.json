    "input": "Given a question, please decompose it into sub-questions. For each sub-question, please answer it in a complete sentence, ending with \"The answer is <a numeric answer>\". When the original question is answerable, please start the subquestion with \"Now we can answer the question: <original question>\".\n\nQuestion 1: Four years ago, Kody was only half as old as Mohamed. If Mohamed is currently twice as 30 years old, how old is Kody?\nQuestion 1.1: How old is Mohamed currently?\nAnswer 1.1: Mohamed is twice as old as 30 years, which means he is 30 * 2 = 60 years old.\nQuestion 1.2: What was Kody's age four years ago, given that it was half of Mohamed's age at that time?\nAnswer 1.2: Four years ago, Mohamed was 60 - 4 = 56 years old, so Kody was half of that, which is 56 / 2 = 28 years old.\nQuestion 1.3: Now we can answer the question: How old is Kody?\nAnswer 1.3: Kody is currently 28 + 4 = 32 years old. The answer is 32.\n\nQuestion 2: On a moonless night, three fireflies danced in the evening breeze. They were joined by four less than a dozen more fireflies before two of the fireflies flew away. How many fireflies remained?\nQuestion 2.1: How many fireflies joined?\nAnswer 2.1: The fireflies were joined by four less than a dozen more fireflies, which are 12 - 4 = 8 fireflies. The answer is 8.\nQuestion 2.2: Now we can answer the question: How many fireflies remained?\nAnswer 2.2: Three fireflies were dancing originally. They were joined by 8 fireflies before two of them flew away. So there were 3 + 8 - 2 = 9 remaining. The answer is 9.\n\nQuestion 3: Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm. Ali gives her sister half of the total money he has and uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. Calculate the amount of money he has after buying the dinner.\nQuestion 3.1: How much money does Ali have after giving half of his total money to his sister?\nAnswer 3.1: Ali initially has four $10 bills and six $20 bills, totaling 4 * 10 + 6 * 20 = 160 dollars. Giving half of this to his sister leaves him with 160 / 2 = 80 dollars. The answer is 80.\nQuestion 3.2: How much money does Ali spend on dinner?\nAnswer 3.2: Ali uses 3/5 of his remaining money, which is 80 dollars, to buy dinner. Therefore, he spends 80 * 3/5 = 48 dollars on dinner. The answer is 48.\nQuestion 3.3: Now we can answer the question: How much money does Ali have after buying the dinner?\nAnswer 3.3: After buying the dinner, Ali has 80 - 48 = 32 dollars left. The answer is 32.\n\nQuestion 4: A car is driving through a tunnel with many turns. After a while, the car must travel through a ring that requires a total of 4 right-hand turns. After the 1st turn, it travels 5 meters. After the 2nd turn, it travels 8 meters. After the 3rd turn, it travels a little further and at the 4th turn, it immediately exits the tunnel. If the car has driven a total of 23 meters around the ring, how far did it have to travel after the 3rd turn?\nQuestion 4.1: How far did the car travel except for the 3rd turn?\nAnswer 4.1: It travels 5 meters after the 1st, 8 meters after the 2nd, and 0 meters after the 4th turn. It's a total of 5 + 8 + 0 = 13 meters. The answer is 13.\nQuestion 4.2: Now we can answer the question: How far did the car have to travel after the 3rd turn?\nAnswer 4.2: The car has driven a total of 23 meters around the ring. It travels 13 meters except for the 3rd turn. So it has to travel 23 - 13 = 10 meters after the 3rd turn. The answer is 10.\n\n",
