    "input": "Given a question, please decompose it into sub-questions. For each sub-question, please answer it in a complete sentence. When the original question is answerable, please start the sub-question with \"Now we can answer the question: <original question>\".\n\nQuestion 1: Genghis Khan: founder and first Great Khan of the Mongol Empire. Are more people today related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar?\nQuestion 1.1: How many descendants of Genghis Khan are estimated to be alive today?\nAnswer 1.1: It is estimated that around 16 million men, roughly 0.5% of the male population worldwide, are direct descendants of Genghis Khan.\nQuestion 1.2: How many descendants of Julius Caesar are estimated to be alive today?\nAnswer 1.2: There are no reliable estimates of Julius Caesar's direct descendants, as he had no known legitimate children who survived to adulthood to continue his lineage.\nQuestion 1.3: Why might there be more descendants of Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar?\nAnswer 1.3: Genghis Khan had numerous wives and children, and his descendants continued to expand and proliferate over centuries. His male lineage spread widely across Asia and beyond, contributing to a significant number of descendants. In contrast, Julius Caesar's lineage did not continue in the same way, as he had no surviving legitimate children to carry on his genetic legacy.\nQuestion 1.4: Now we can answer the question: Are more people today related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar?\nAnswer 1.4: Given the vast number of descendants attributed to Genghis Khan and the lack of known direct descendants of Julius Caesar, it is true that more people today are related to Genghis Khan than to Julius Caesar. The answer is true.\n\nQuestion 2: The Police: English rock band. Could the members of The Police perform lawful arrests?\nQuestion 2.1: Who are the members of The Police?\nAnswer 2.1: The members of The Police are Sting (Gordon Sumner), Andy Summers, and Stewart Copeland.\nQuestion 2.2: What professions do the members of The Police have?\nAnswer 2.2: The members of The Police are professional musicians and artists.\nQuestion 2.3: What are the requirements for performing lawful arrests?\nAnswer 2.3: To perform lawful arrests, individuals typically need to be law enforcement officers or possess special legal authority granted by the government, including proper training, certification, and jurisdiction.\nQuestion 2.4: Do the members of The Police have the legal authority to perform lawful arrests?\nAnswer 2.4: The members of The Police, being musicians and not law enforcement officers, do not have the legal authority to perform lawful arrests.\nQuestion 2.5: Now we can answer the question: Could the members of The Police perform lawful arrests?\nAnswer 2.5: Since the members of The Police are not law enforcement officers and do not possess the necessary legal authority or training, they cannot perform lawful arrests. The answer is false.\n\nQuestion 3: Depression (mood): state of low mood and fatigue. Would a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar cheer up a depressed friend?\nQuestion 3.1: What is a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI)?\nAnswer 3.1: A Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) is a type of antidepressant medication that works by inhibiting the activity of monoamine oxidase, an enzyme that breaks down neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, thereby increasing their levels in the brain.\nQuestion 3.2: How do MAOIs help in treating depression?\nAnswer 3.2: MAOIs help in treating depression by preventing the breakdown of mood-regulating neurotransmitters, which can help alleviate symptoms of depression by improving mood and energy levels.\nQuestion 3.3: Are there any dietary restrictions or considerations when taking MAOIs?\nAnswer 3.3: Yes, there are significant dietary restrictions when taking MAOIs. Consuming foods high in tyramine, such as certain cheeses, smoked meats, and some types of beer, can cause dangerous interactions, including high blood pressure and hypertensive crisis.\nQuestion 3.4: Is it safe or effective to consume a candy bar containing MAOIs?\nAnswer 3.4: It is neither safe nor effective to consume a candy bar containing MAOIs without medical supervision. MAOIs are prescription medications that require careful monitoring by a healthcare professional due to potential side effects and dietary interactions.\nQuestion 3.5: Now we can answer the question: Would a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar cheer up a depressed friend?\nAnswer 3.5: Given the need for medical supervision and the potential risks associated with MAOIs, it would not be safe or advisable to use a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar to cheer up a depressed friend. The answer is false.\n\nQuestion 4: Grey seal: species of seal. Would a dog respond to a bell before a Grey seal?\nQuestion 4.1: What is the typical behavior of dogs in response to a bell?\nAnswer 4.1: Dogs can be trained to respond to a bell through a process called classical conditioning, as demonstrated in Pavlov's experiments where dogs learned to associate the sound of a bell with food, leading to a conditioned response of salivation or excitement.\nQuestion 4.2: Can Grey seals be trained to respond to a bell?\nAnswer 4.2: Yes, Grey seals can be trained to respond to a bell or other auditory cues through training and conditioning, similar to how other animals can learn to associate sounds with certain actions or rewards.\nQuestion 4.3: What factors influence the speed at which animals respond to conditioning?\nAnswer 4.3: The speed at which animals respond to conditioning depends on several factors, including the species, the individual animal's learning capacity, the consistency of training, the type of reward, and prior experiences with similar stimuli.\nQuestion 4.4: Which animal, a dog or a Grey seal, is likely to respond to a bell more quickly based on typical conditioning experiences?\nAnswer 4.4: Based on typical conditioning experiences, dogs are likely to respond more quickly to a bell than Grey seals due to their domestication, familiarity with human interaction, and a long history of being trained for various tasks and cues.\nQuestion 4.5: Now we can answer the question: Would a dog respond to a bell before a Grey seal?\nAnswer 4.5: Given that dogs are more commonly trained and conditioned to respond to bells and other cues quickly, it is likely that a dog would respond to a bell before a Grey seal. The answer is true.\n\n",
